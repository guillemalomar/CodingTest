# JobOfferTest

This is my solution for the Thoughtworks code test.

A general view of the folders structure can be seen in:
    ProjectFolder.png


To run the applications, type from the main folder:

1) Trains Application
       python TrainsPythonGA/src/TrainApp.py $optional_input_path

2) Conference Track Management
       python ConferencetrackmanagementPythonGA/src/SchedulerApp.py $optional_input_path

3) Merchant's Guide to the Galaxy
       python MerchantsguidetothegalaxyPythonGA/src/CoinValueQuestionsParser.py $optional_input_path

As requested, several tests have been added.
In order to run them, execute them from the main folder. Paths to each of the tests files can be
found in the file tests_runner.txt
